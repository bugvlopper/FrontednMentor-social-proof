## My process

### Built with

- JSX
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile workflow (I'm still doing my  mobile design after the desktop it's easyier for me to structure my work )
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned to use component in better way than before

exemple:

```js
<div className="bottom-container">
            {data.map((data, index)=> <Card key={index} data={data}/>)}
</div>
```
More i practice more i want to learn ! x) Let's see what i can do in the next challenge ! ;) 

### Continued development

I'm still in progress with using react, i start to understand the power of components and recursivity of react.
